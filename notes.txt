To create a new sqlite database:

Go to the directory where you want the database to live and do sqlite3 name.db


When the local has the correct info that the remote doesn't have, but there are merge conflicts, you can:
git push origin your-local-branch-name --force

Notes on inserting rows from python code:
To insert rows into a table in an SQLite database, you use the following steps:

First, connect to the SQLite database by calling the sqlite3.connect() function. The function returns a Connection object.
Second, create a Cursor object by calling the cursor() method of the Connection object.
Third, execute an INSERT statement to insert data into the target table. If you want to pass arguments to the INSERT statement, 
use the question mark (?) as the placeholder for each argument.
